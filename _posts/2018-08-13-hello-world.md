I just created this site and am now learning what Jekyll can do. If you want a site like mine, head over to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Here's some Rust code for saying hello.

{% highlight rust %}
fn hello(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello {}!", name);
}
{% endhighlight %}

I aim to make this site my online CV and blog.
